## 3.1 Overview

<span style="color: #808080;">[Proposed Method]</span> This chapter presents the proposed method for unsupervised state-space bucketing via sample gradients. The central idea is to use the learning signal itself—the per-sample gradients of the loss with respect to the head parameters—as the basis for partitioning the state space, rather than relying on handcrafted features or hidden-layer activations. 

<span style="color: #808080;">[Steps 1-2]</span> The method unfolds through a carefully orchestrated sequence designed to balance computational tractability with the stringent efficiency demands of on-device inference. It begins by training a base NNUE model on the complete dataset, which establishes a shared L1 representation and provides a stable reference point for subsequent gradient computations. From this foundation, normalized per-sample gradients are extracted with respect to the trainable head parameters, effectively capturing the direction in which each position would push the head during optimization.

<span style="color: #808080;">[Steps 3-4]</span> These gradient vectors then become the substrate for clustering, yielding a partition of the state space into $B$ distinct buckets that group together positions exhibiting similar learning dynamics. To enable fast routing at inference time without the prohibitive cost of recomputing gradients, a lightweight linear dispatcher is trained to predict bucket assignments directly from the frozen L1 activations. 

<span style="color: #808080;">[Steps 5]</span> The pipeline culminates in fine-tuning a dedicated expert head on each bucket ( #todo decided by the dispatcher), initialized from the base model while keeping the L1 weights frozen. The end result is a mixture-of-experts NNUE architecture in which each expert develops specialised competence over a coherent region of the state space, guided by a dispatcher that introduces negligible overhead to the evaluation function.

## 3.2 Notation and Definitions

### 3.2.6 Relationship Between $\Delta_i$ and $\delta_i$

<span style="color: #808080;">[Two Concepts]</span> A crucial distinction in this work is between **per-sample gradients** $\Delta_i$ and **task vectors** $\delta_i$. These two concepts are similar to each other, but it is worth emphasizing that the task vector $\delta_i = \theta_i - \theta_{\text{base}}$ is the difference in model parameters between before and after the fine-tuning, while the sample gradient $\Delta_i = \nabla_{w_{\text{head}}} \mathcal{L}(\hat{f}_{w_{\text{base}}}(s_i), v_i)$ is the gradient of the loss with respect to the head parameters, evaluated at a single position $s_i$ using the base model. 

<span style="color: #808080;">[Central Hypothesis]</span> The central hypothesis of this work is that clustering positions by their $\Delta_i$ yields a partitioning for which the resulting learning dynamics are maximally diverse - each expert specializes in a distinct region of the state space - and that the dispatcher is able to approximate this partitioning with enough accuracy to preserve its general structure.

---

## 3.3 Step 1: Train the Base Model

<span style="color: #808080;">[Base Model]</span> The first step of our method is to train a **base evaluation model** that will serve as the foundation for all subsequent steps. This model provides two essential functions: it supplies the reference point from which the sample gradients are computed, and it provides the frozen L1 representation used by the dispatcher at inference time.

### 3.3.1 Model Architecture

<span style="color: #808080;">[Architecture]</span> The base model follows the NNUE architecture described in Section 2.1.3: a sparse accumulator layer $W_{L1}$ that maps a binary feature representation to a hidden state $h \in \mathbb{R}^h$, followed by a small fully-connected head $(W_{L2}, W_{out})$ that produces WDL logits. The architecture is kept deliberately small to reflect the resource constraints of the target hardware—specifically, a hidden dimension of $h = [W]$ for the accumulator and $H = [H]$ for the L2 layer, resulting in approximately [n_params] trainable parameters.

### 3.3.2 Training Objective

<span style="color: #808080;">[Loss Choice]</span> The model is trained to minimize the **soft cross-entropy loss** between its predicted WDL distribution and the teacher labels provided by Lc0 (see Section 4.1.4). For a batch of $N$ positions with teacher probabilities $\hat{p}_i = (\hat{P}_i(W), \hat{P}_i(D), \hat{P}_i(L))$ and model outputs $p_i = (P_i(W), P_i(D), P_i(L))$, the loss is:

$$\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ \hat{P}_i(W) \log P_i(W) + \hat{P}_i(D) \log P_i(D) + \hat{P}_i(L) \log P_i(L) \right]$$

#note for me: Soft cross-entropy (or soft-target cross-entropy) is a generalized loss function in machine learning that uses full probability distributions instead of strict "hard" one-hot vectors for target labels

<span style="color: #808080;">[Why Soft-CE]</span> This choice of loss is deliberate. Unlike mean squared error on a scalar value (centipawns or expected reward $v = P(W) - P(L)$), the cross-entropy loss encourages the model to match the **full outcome distribution** rather than just its mean. This provides a richer training signal and naturally handles the non-linear relationship between WDL probabilities and the scalar evaluation used during search.

### 3.3.3 Training Protocol

<span style="color: #808080;">[Training Protocol]</span> The base model is trained on the full dataset of approximately [dataset_size] positions using the Adam optimiser with a learning rate of [lr_start], linearly decayed to [lr_end] over the course of training. We use a batch size of [batch_size] and train until convergence on the held-out test set ([test_fraction] of the total dataset). All training is performed in PyTorch on a DGX Nvidia Spark GPU.

### 3.3.4 The Role of the Base Model

<span style="color: #808080;">[Gradient Reference]</span> Once trained, the base model $w_{\text{base}} = (W_{L1}, W_{L2}^{\text{base}}, W_{out}^{\text{base}})$ serves several critical functions in our pipeline, one of which is as reference point for gradients: For each position $s_i$, we compute the sample gradient $\Delta_i$ evaluated at the base model. This gradient represents the direction in which the head would need to move to better fit that specific position—the *learning signal* that drives our bucketing.

<span style="color: #808080;">[Frozen Routing]</span> An other important role of the base model is as frozen representation for routing. The L1 weights $W_{L1}$ are frozen after base training and are never updated during expert fine-tuning. This ensures that all experts operate on the same shared representation, and that the dispatcher can rely on stable L1 activations $h = W_{L1} \cdot x$ as input features.

<span style="color: #808080;">[Expert Init]</span> Finally, the base model is of course also the starting point for expert fine-tuning. Each expert head $(W_{L2}^{(i)}, W_{out}^{(i)})$ is initialised from the base head $(W_{L2}^{\text{base}}, W_{out}^{\text{base}})$ before being fine-tuned on its assigned bucket. 

#note here is where the main talk about the "frozen weights" should happen

### 3.3.5 Why Freeze L1?

<span style="color: #808080;">[Fixed representation space]</span> Freezing the L1 layer is a deliberate design choice. The accumulator is the most expensive component of the NNUE architecture in terms of parameter count, and updating it during fine-tuning would be computationally prohibitive. More importantly, freezing L1 ensures that the representation space remains the same for all experts: the dispatcher, trained on L1 activations, can reliably route positions without needing to account for different representations. This stability is essential for the lightweight inference pipeline, where the dispatcher must operate with negligible overhead.

---

## 3.4 Step 2: Compute Sample Gradients

<span style="color: #808080;">[Sample Gradients]</span> With the base model trained, the second step is to compute, for each position in the dataset, the sample gradient of the loss with respect to the head parameters. These gradients encode the direction in which the head parameters would need to move to improve the prediction for each individual position. They represent the *learning signal* that we will later use for bucketing.

### 3.4.1 Definition of Sample Gradient

<span style="color: #808080;">[Definition]</span> For each position $s_i$ in the dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(s_i, v_i)\}_{i=1}^N$, the sample gradient is defined as:

$$\Delta_i = \nabla_{w_{\text{head}}} \mathcal{L}(\hat{f}_{w^{\text{base}}}(s_i), v_i)$$

where:

- $w_{\text{head}} = \text{vec}(W_{L2}, W_{out})$ is the vector of all head parameters (the L2 weights and biases, and the output weights and biases)
- $\hat{f}_{w_{\text{base}}}$ is the base model evaluated at the current weights
- $\mathcal{L}$ is the soft cross-entropy loss on WDL probabilities
- $v_i = (p_W, p_D, p_L)$ is the teacher label for position $s_i$

<span style="color: #808080;">[At Base Model]</span> The gradient is computed at the base model $w_{\text{base}}$, before any fine-tuning occurs. It represents the instantaneous direction in weight space that would reduce the loss on that specific position, independent of all other positions.

### 3.4.2 Implementation

<span style="color: #808080;">[Implementation]</span> In practice, the gradient computation leverages PyTorch's `torch.autograd.grad` function, which efficiently computes sample gradients for an entire batch of inputs in a single operation. Crucially, these gradients are computed only with respect to the head parameters—namely $(W_{L2}, W_{out})$​—while the L1 accumulator weights remain excluded from this differentiation.

<span style="color: #808080;">[Forward then Grad]</span> The workflow begins with a forward pass through the model for a batch of positions, producing WDL predictions that are then compared against teacher labels via cross-entropy loss. Calling `torch.autograd.grad(loss, head_parameters, retain_graph=False)` yields the desired gradients, which are subsequently detached from the computation graph and flattened into a single vector representation for each position. This entire computation runs fully parallelised on the GPU and completes in a single pass over the dataset, with the resulting gradient tensors persisted to disk for use in the downstream clustering stage.

### 3.4.3 Normalisation

<span style="color: #808080;">[Normalisation]</span> The raw gradients can have highly variable magnitudes depending on the position, the current state of the model, and on weather the multiplicity of the state is considered or not. The *L2 normalization* of each gradient vector has been shown to work well in gradient-clustering literature (ELREA, GradientSpace) and preserves the relative angular structure of the gradients.

$$\Delta_i^{\text{norm}} = \frac{\Delta_i}{\|\Delta_i\| + \epsilon}$$

<span style="color: #808080;">[Direction, not Magnitude]</span> This projects each gradient onto the unit hypersphere, preserving direction while removing magnitude information. This is appropriate because the *direction* of the gradient encodes the type of specialisation needed, while the magnitude is more sensitive to the current loss value and position difficulty.

#todo distinction between L2 norm and L2 layer?

### 3.4.4 Storage and Compute Considerations

<span style="color: #808080;">[Storage Cost]</span> Computing and storing sample gradients for [dataset_size] positions presents practical challenges. Each gradient vector has dimension $P_{\text{head}} \approx [P_head]$ (flattened L2 and output weights). Storing this as 32-bit floats would require approximately:

$$[dataset_{size}] \times [P_{head}] \times 4 \text{ bytes}$$

#todo considerations on whether to introduce rounding, and whether to use just part of the dataset

## 3.5 Step 3: Cluster Sample Gradients

<span style="color: #808080;">[Clustering]</span> With the normalised sample gradients $\{\Delta_i^{\text{norm}}\}_{i=1}^N$ computed for every position in the dataset, the third step is to partition the data into $B$ clusters (buckets) such that positions with similar learning signals are grouped together. This partition will define the assignment of positions to expert heads during fine-tuning.

### 3.5.1 The Objective of Clustering

<span style="color: #808080;">[Objective]</span> Recall the central hypothesis of this work: clustering positions by their sample gradients $\Delta_i$ yields a partition $\mathcal{P} = \{\mathcal{D}_1, \dots, \mathcal{D}_B\}$ for which the resulting task vectors $\delta_i = \theta_i - \theta_{\text{base}}$ are maximally diverse. The role of the clustering algorithm is to discover a partition that approximates this objective. From a practical standpoint, we seek an efficient clustering algorithm that produces clusters that are cohesive, balanced, stable, and, hopefully, as separated as possible. Different clustering algorithms make different trade-offs with respect to these criteria. We consider two broad families: fixed-$B$ algorithms and density-based algorithms.

### 3.5.2 Fixed-$B$ Algorithms: K-Means and Variants

<span style="color: #808080;">[K-Means]</span> The most widely used clustering algorithm is **K-Means**, which partitions the data into $B$ clusters by minimising the within-cluster sum of squares. For a set of clusters $\{\mathcal{C}_1, \dots, \mathcal{C}_B\}$, K-Means minimises:

$$\sum_{k=1}^B \sum_{i \in \mathcal{C}_k} \|\Delta_i - \mu_k\|^2$$

where $\mu_k = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}_k|} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{C}_k} \Delta_i$ is the centroid of cluster $k$. This algorithm is fast and well-understood. Specifically, *Mini-Batch K-Means* is particularly attractive for our scale, as it efficiently handles large datasets by processing data in mini-batches, making it suitable for our dataset, that comprises of millions of chess positions. It reduces memory requirements and converges faster than standard K-Means, while producing nearly identical results.

#todo Disadvantages:
- **Sensitivity to initialisation**: While k-means++ mitigates this, K-Means can still converge to local optima.
- **Assumption of spherical clusters**: K-Means performs best when clusters are roughly spherical and of similar size. Our gradient space may not satisfy this assumption.
- **Fixed $B$ is a hyperparameter**: The choice of $B$ is critical and must be determined separately (see Section 3.5.4).
- **Outlier sensitivity**: K-Means can be influenced by outliers, which may distort centroids.

### 3.5.3 Density-Based Algorithms

<span style="color: #808080;">[Density-Based]</span> An alternative family of algorithms, **density-based clustering**, does not require a fixed number of clusters. Instead, these methods identify clusters as regions of high density separated by regions of low density.

<span style="color: #808080;">[Density Peak]</span> **Density Peak Clustering** (Rodriguez & Laio, 2014) is a particularly relevant algorithm for our setting. It works by identifying cluster centres as points that have high local density (many neighbours within a cutoff distance) and are far from points with higher density (suggesting they are local maxima).

<span style="color: #808080;">[Automatic B]</span> The number of clusters emerges naturally from the data: each point with density higher than all its neighbours and with large distance to the nearest higher-density point is a cluster centre. The remaining points are assigned to the same cluster as their nearest higher-density neighbour.

<span style="color: #808080;">[Why This]</span> We chose to use this algorithm because it automatically determines $B$, so it will be interesting to find out what the clusters of board positions actually represent. This algorithm is also notoriously robustness to outliers; points with low density and large distance to higher-density points are naturally identified as outliers.

#todo maybe we choose a different one (must test)

#todo Disadvantages:
- **Parameter sensitivity**: The algorithm requires choosing a distance cutoff (for density estimation) and a threshold for the distance to higher-density points. These parameters can significantly affect the number of clusters.
- **Computational cost**: Computing pairwise distances for [dataset_size] points is prohibitive (O(N²)). We would need to use approximations (e.g., approximate nearest neighbours) or subsample the data.
- **Cluster size imbalance**: Density-based methods may produce clusters of very different sizes, which can be problematic for expert fine-tuning (some experts would have too little data).
- **Unstable number of clusters**: The number of clusters can vary with the parameters or with slight perturbations in the data, complicating the design of a fixed-architecture MoE.

<span style="color: #808080;">[DBSCAN]</span> DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) defines clusters as regions of high density separated by regions of low density, using two parameters: $\varepsilon$ (neighbourhood radius) and `min_samples` (minimum points to form a dense region). It does not require the number of clusters $B$ as an input and can label outliers as noise. It avoids the need to pre-specify $B$, which could be useful when the natural structure of the gradient space is unknown. It can detect clusters of arbitrary shapes and is robust to outliers, potentially identifying positions that yield uninformative gradients.

#todo **Why no.** DBSCAN performs poorly on high-dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality, where density estimates become unreliable. Its time complexity scales poorly with dataset size, making it infeasible for our 5 million positions in 17,000 dimensions. It is also sensitive to its hyperparameters and struggles with clusters of varying densities. We therefore adopt Mini-Batch K-Means as our default clustering algorithm.

### 3.5.4 Choosing $B$ and the Algorithm

<span style="color: #808080;">[Choosing B]</span> The choice between fixed-$B$ and density-based clustering depends on the relative importance of architectural efficiency and data-driven discovery. A density-based approach that automatically determines $B$ could reveal the natural structure in the gradient space, potentially identifying a number of clusters that better reflects the underlying distribution of learning signals. On the other hand, hardware constraints might impose a hard limit on how many expert heads our device is allowed to store based on our architecture of choice.

## 3.6 Step 4: Train the Dispatcher

<span style="color: #808080;">[Why the dispatcher]</span> The clustering step yields a partition of the training dataset into $B$ buckets, but this partition is defined in terms of sample gradients. At inference time, gradients are unavailable; computing them would require the teacher evaluation of the position, which we of corse don't have. To route a new position to the appropriate expert, we therefore need a mechanism that predicts the bucket assignment from features that are already computed during the normal forward pass. The dispatcher $g_\phi$ serves this purpose.

### 3.6.1 Architecture

<span style="color: #808080;">[Architecture]</span> The dispatcher is a linear classifier that takes as input the concatenated L1 activations $h = [h_{\text{own}} \| h_{\text{opp}}] \in \mathbb{R}^{2W}$ and produces a vector of logits over the $B$ buckets:

$$z = W_{\text{disp}} \, h + b_{\text{disp}}$$

where $W_{\text{disp}} \in \mathbb{R}^{2W \times B}$ and $b_{\text{disp}} \in \mathbb{R}^B$. During training, a softmax function converts these logits into a probability distribution over buckets, and the model is trained to predict the cluster assignments produced by the clustering step. At inference, the softmax is discarded and the predicted bucket is simply the argmax of the logits:

$$g_\phi(s) = \arg\max_i z_i$$

This design ensures that routing adds only a matrix-vector multiplication and a comparison, both of which are inexpensive integer operations.

#todo maybe $h_{\text{own}}$ is enough for the dispatcher

### 3.6.2 Why a Linear Model

<span style="color: #808080;">[Efficiency of the linear model]</span> The choice of a linear dispatcher is deliberate and follows directly from the inference-time constraints discussed in Section 2.1.5. A linear layer with $2W$ inputs and $B$ outputs requires $2W \times B + B$ parameters, which for $W=128$ and $B=8$ amounts to approximately 2,056 parameters. This is small enough to fit comfortably in the flash memory of a microcontroller alongside the expert heads. The computation itself is a single matrix-vector product, which can be implemented with integer arithmetic and adds negligible latency to the evaluation function.

<span style="color: #808080;">[The linear model is enough]</span> A more expressive dispatcher, such as a multi-layer perceptron with hidden layers, could potentially achieve higher classification accuracy. However, the additional parameters and non-linearities would increase both memory footprint and inference cost. Given the extreme efficiency requirements of the target hardware, we prioritize simplicity and speed over marginal gains in routing accuracy. As we discuss in Section 3.6.4, the linear dispatcher is sufficient to capture the coarse structure of the partition.

#todo check reference to 3.6.4

### 3.6.3 Training

<span style="color: #808080;">[Training the dispatcher]</span> The dispatcher is trained on the same dataset used for clustering, with the cluster labels serving as targets. The input features are the L1 activations $h_i = W_{L1} \cdot x_i$, which are already computed during the base model's forward pass and can be cached for the entire dataset. The loss is the standard cross-entropy between the predicted distribution and the one-hot cluster assignment:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{disp}} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \log (g_\phi(s_i)_{c_i})$$

where $c_i$ is the cluster index assigned to position $s_i$. We optimize this loss using Adam with a learning rate of $10^{-2}$, decayed to $10^{-3}$ over the course of training. Training typically converges within a few epochs, and we use early stopping on a held-out validation set to prevent overfitting. Because the dispatcher is a small linear model, the entire training procedure takes only a few minutes on a GPU.

#todo remove GPU remark?

### 3.6.4 Can a Linear Dispatcher Capture the Clustering?

<span style="color: #808080;">[Expressiveness of the dispatcher]</span> The sample-gradient space is highly dimensional ($P_{\text{head}} \approx 17,000$), while the dispatcher operates on the L1 activations, which have dimension $2W = 256$. A natural question is whether a linear function of these activations can accurately predict the cluster assignments derived from gradients. The answer depends on how much information about the learning signal is already encoded in the L1 representation.

#todo In practice, we observe that a linear dispatcher achieves classification accuracy in the range of ...

### 3.6.5 Fixed vs. Re-Assigned Cluster Assignments

<span style="color: #808080;">[Why the decision matters]</span> A subtle but important design decision concerns the relationship between the dispatcher and the expert fine-tuning. During the fine-tuning step (Section 3.7), each position is assigned to a bucket. We can either use the original cluster assignments produced by the clustering algorithm, or we can re-assign positions using the dispatcher's predictions. These two options have different implications.

<span style="color: #808080;">[Reassigning positions]</span> If we use the dispatcher to re-assign positions, the experts are trained on the buckets that the dispatcher believes are correct, rather than the buckets discovered by clustering. This could potentially align the experts more closely with the dispatcher's behavior at inference time. The downside is that some of the structure and complexity of the original clustering is lost, in favor of a simpler, linear partitioning.

#todo did not yet decide witch one is better, maybe try both?

## 3.7 Step 5: Fine-Tune Expert Heads

<span style="color: #808080;">[Context for MoE]</span> The final step of the pipeline produces the specialised experts. Once the clustering has defined the partition and the dispatcher has been trained to approximate it, we fine-tune a separate head on each bucket, starting from the base model and keeping the L1 representation frozen. The result is a set of $B$ expert heads, each adapted to a distinct region of the state space, sharing a common L1 accumulator.

### 3.7.1 What Is Trained and What Is Frozen

<span style="color: #808080;">[What is frozen]</span> The L1 accumulator remains frozen throughout this step, as it has been since the base model was trained. This is not merely a convenience but a structural requirement: the dispatcher relies on L1 activations to route positions, and those activations must be computed by the same weight matrix regardless of which expert is selected. If each expert were to fine-tune its own L1 weights, the dispatcher would need to account for $B$ different representation spaces, and the inference pipeline would become unworkable. Freezing L1 also keeps the memory footprint constant: all experts share the same accumulator, and only the head parameters differ between them.

<span style="color: #808080;">[What is trained]</span> Each expert head consists of the L2 layer and the output layer, parameterised by $(W_{L2}^{(i)},b_{L2}^{(i)},W_{\text{out}}^{(i)},b_{\text{out}}^{(i)})$. These are initialised from the corresponding parameters of the base model, so that every expert starts from the same well-trained foundation. The only thing that distinguishes one expert from another is the data on which it is fine-tuned—the subset of positions assigned to its bucket by the clustering step.

#todo omit bias?
#todo will we try also double-hidden sparse head?

### 3.7.2 Training Procedure

<span style="color: #808080;">[What is trained]</span> For each bucket $\mathcal{D}_i$, we fine-tune a copy of the base head on the positions in that bucket, using the same soft cross-entropy loss and optimiser as in the base training. The L1 activations are pre-computed once for the entire dataset and cached, so the fine-tuning step only requires forward and backward passes through the small head, not the full model. This makes the procedure extremely fast: fine-tuning $B$ heads on subsets of a dataset of millions of positions takes only a fraction of the time required to train the base model.

<span style="color: #808080;">[Training specs]</span> We use a short training schedule, typically one or two sweeps over the bucket, with early stopping based on the cross-entropy on a held-out portion of the bucket. Depending on the dataset size, one of two approaches is best. If the buckets are too small ( #todo reference overfitting plot), training for too long risks overfitting. In our specific case data is abundant, and the goal is to reach the best possible performance on each bucket in isolation, to produce a set of experts whose combined behaviour significantly improves upon the single base head. The learning rate is set lower than in base training, to avoid large deviations from the base head that could destabilise the shared L1 representation.

#todo rephrase?
#todo decide numbers like lr

### 3.7.3 Data Availability per Expert

Partitioning the dataset into BB buckets means that each expert sees only a fraction of the total data. If the partition is balanced, each expert is fine-tuned on approximately N/BN/B positions. For B=8B=8 and N=5N=5 million, this amounts to roughly 625,000 positions per expert, which is still a substantial training set. However, if the clustering produces imbalanced buckets, some experts may be trained on far fewer positions, which can lead to underfitting or unstable training.

This is one of the reasons why we monitor the cluster size distribution as part of the validation diagnostics in Section 3.5.5. If a bucket is too small to support stable fine-tuning, several remedies are possible: merging it with a nearby bucket, reducing the number of experts, or allowing the expert to be trained on a slightly larger set that includes positions near the cluster boundary. The latter approach is particularly appealing because it acknowledges that the boundary between two buckets is not sharp in the original gradient space: positions near the boundary may share characteristics of both regions and can reasonably contribute to the training of either expert.

We do not adopt this relaxation in the present work, but we note it as a natural extension that could improve the robustness of the method when the partition is uneven.

### 3.7.4 The Resulting MoE Model

At the end of this step, we have a complete mixture-of-experts evaluation function. The model consists of three components: the frozen L1 accumulator, which is shared across all experts; the dispatcher, which maps L1 activations to a bucket index; and the BB expert heads, each containing its own L2 and output parameters. During inference, a position is encoded into its sparse feature representation, passed through L1 to obtain the accumulator vector, routed by the dispatcher to a single bucket, and finally evaluated by the corresponding expert head. The output is a WDL distribution from the side-to-move perspective, from which the scalar evaluation is derived as usual.

The inference cost is therefore one L1 forward pass (which is incremental during search), one linear dispatcher operation, and one head forward pass. Compared to the single-head base model, the only additional cost is the dispatcher, which as we have seen adds a matrix-vector multiplication of negligible size. The experts themselves are not more expensive than the base head: they have the same architecture, and only one is evaluated per position. The memory cost is BB times the size of the head parameters, which remains small relative to the L1 accumulator. This is the essential trade-off of the method: we gain specialisation at the cost of additional head parameters, while keeping the inference path as lean as the base model.
